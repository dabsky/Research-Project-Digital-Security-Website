      <u> What is a Trojan Horse? </u>
      <p>
        A Trojan horse, often known as a Trojan, is malicious malware or software that appears to be genuine yet has the ability to take control of your computer. A Trojan is a computer program that is meant to hurt, disrupt, steal, or otherwise harm your data or network.
      </p>

      <u> Ways it Affects Computers </u>
      <p>
        Cybercriminals can use Trojans to spy on you, steal your personal information, and obtain backdoor access to your computer.
      </p>

      <u> Ways You Can Get It </u>

      </p>

      <u> Symptoms </u>
      <p>
        The first sign that a Trojan virus has infiltrated your computer is when it behaves strangely and the entire machine behaves differently. This behavior includes the mouse moving on, its own programs opening automatically and some applications refusing to start.
      </p>

      <u> Removal </u>
      <p>
        Some Trojans can be removed from your computer by deactivating startup items from untrustworthy sources. To get the best results, start by rebooting your device into safe mode, which will prevent the virus from preventing you from uninstalling it.
      </p>

      <u> Prevention </u>
      <p>
        Getting strong antivirus software is a proven approach to keep your Mac and data safe.With this in mind, the easiest way to avoid Trojans is to never open an email attachment or start the software from a source you don't know, which includes all files obtained through peer-to-peer applications or websites. Keep your software up to date at all times. This is especially true for critical programs such as your operating system and web browser.
