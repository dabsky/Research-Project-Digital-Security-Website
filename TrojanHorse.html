      <u> Removal </u>

        Some Trojans can be removed from your computer by deactivating startup items from untrustworthy sources. To get the best results, start by rebooting your device into safe mode, which will prevent the virus from preventing you from uninstalling it.

      <u> Prevention </u>
      <p>
        Getting strong antivirus software is a proven approach to keep your Mac and data safe.With this in mind, the easiest way to avoid Trojans is to never open an email attachment or start the software from a source you don't know, which includes all files obtained through peer-to-peer applications or websites. Keep your software up to date at all times. This is especially true for critical programs such as your operating system and web browser.
