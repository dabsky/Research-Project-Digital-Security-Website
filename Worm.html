    <h1> Worm </h1>
      <u> What is a Worm? </u>
      <p>
        A computer worm is a <a href = "Malware.html"> <p1> malware </p1> </a> that reproduces itself and spreads over network connections. It does this by exploiting parts of an operating system that are automatic and invisible to the user. It’s different to a <a href = "Virus.html"> <p2> virus <p2> </a> in that a <a href = "Virus.html"> <p2> virus <p2> </a> requires human interaction, and a worm can spread automatically without a person doing anything.
      </p>

      <u> Ways it Affects Computers </u>
      <ul>
        <li> computer having performance issues </li>
        <li> System freezes/crashes unexpectedly (these issues happen because worm often uses large amounts of bandwidth, so affected servers, networks, and individual systems are often overloaded and stop responding) </li>
        <li> Unusual sounds/images </li>
        <li> Appearances of unfamiliar files </li>
        <li> Email messages sent to contacts that the user didn’t actually send (this also refers to email worms.) These work by creating and sending outbound messages to all the addresses in a user's contact list. The messages include a malicious executable file that infects the new system when the recipient opens it </li>
      </ul>

      <u> Symptoms </u>
      <ul>
        <li> Keep an eye on your hard drive space (because worms replicate again and again, they often take up large amounts of hard drive space.) </li>
        <li> Monitor speed and performance </li>
        <li> Be on the lookout for missing or new files (worms can delete files on your computer and then replace them with something else. If you see new files or notice some that are missing, it may be because of a worm). </li>
      </ul>

      <u> Removal </u>
      <dl>
        <dt> The safest and most effective way to disinfect a computer that has been infested by a worm is by using a dedicated removal tool. </dt>
          <dd> Ex: Avast! Virus cleaner - Download this, and this virus cleaner will check if a worm is running, and terminate the process if necessary. It will remove any tracks of a worm. </dd>
      </dl>

      <u> Prevention </u>
      <ul>
        <li> Good cybersecurity hygiene </li>
        <li> Install operating system updates and software patches </li>
        <li> Use firewalls (will help reduce access to systems by malicious software) </li>
        <li> Use antivirus softwares (prevents malicious software from running) </li>
        <li> Use encryption ( protects sensitive data stored on computers, servers, and mobile devices </li>
        <li> Update all antivirus signatures </li>
        <li> Confirm that the operating system and all applications are up to date and patched </li>
      </ul>

      <u> Conclusion </u>
      <p>
        A computer worm is sneaky in that it doesn’t need human intervention to attack a system, but instead it does that on its own by replicating itself into the system, and destroying what it can. For those reasons it can be difficult to remove a computer worm. At times the only thing possible left to do is to wipe a system entirely, but there are many other ways it can be prevented, and one can start by being aware of the ways it attacks a system.
